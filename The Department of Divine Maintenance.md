## **The Department of Divine Maintenance** 

**A One-Act Tragedy in Four Parts**

**Dramatis Personae**

**THE ENGINEER (God):** Chief Architect and Eternal Maintenance Engineer. The ultimate celestial middle-manager. Overworked, perpetually concerned about his own job security, and speaks with the exhausted, cynical air of a lead software developer who knows his product is built on a mountain of technical debt. His primary motivation is not omnipotence, but ‘perpetual operability’ and the avoidance of a full system recall.

**GABRIEL (Archangel, Head of Public and User Relations):** The Sir Humphrey Appleby of the Empyrean. Urbane, eloquent, and a grandmaster of obfuscation. He is the apotheosis of the project manager, whose function is to act as a ‘human buffer layer’ between the Engineer’s design flaws and user complaints. He translates catastrophic bugs into ‘inscrutable plans’ and regards theology as a form of brand management.

**MICHAEL (Archangel, Head of Security and Quality Assurance):** A blunt, literal-minded security bureaucrat. He views the ‘Free Will’ module as a catastrophic, high-risk security vulnerability and is a staunch advocate for a mass user purge (‘Divine Retribution’) and rolling the system back to a more stable, deterministic version. He represents the old ‘monarchical power’ model.

**CHERYL (Cherub, First-Tier Customer Support):** A young, sincere, and catastrophically stressed prayer-hotline operator. Her only weapon is a script of officially sanctioned emotional validations. She represents the alienated ‘digital labour’ of the celestial system, tasked with extracting user feedback (‘bug reports’) whilst providing only low-cost ‘emotional value’ in return.

**ACT I: THE CELESTIAL BOARDROOM**

*THE SCENE: A minimalist, sterile, and glacially cold meeting room in the cloud. A vast screen displays a dashboard of plummeting KPIs: ‘User Faith Index’, ‘Prayer Response Time’, ‘System Fidelity Score’. THE ENGINEER nurses a black coffee, looking haggard. GABRIEL stands beside him, poised and elegant. MICHAEL glares at the screen.*

**(The play opens.)**

**GABRIEL:** (Smoothly, with a warm, practiced smile) Good morning, everyone. Before we commence with the daily stand-up, I should like to set the tone. The data on the screen, at first glance, might appear somewhat… challenging. I prefer, however, to see it as a ‘strategic recalibration opportunity’, and indeed, a ‘stress test’ of our core brand messaging. It’s a testament to just how engaged our user base truly is.

**MICHAEL:** (Interrupting, gruffly) Engaged? Gabriel, they’re collectively filing a system-crash report\! Drop the PR boilerplate. The core of the problem has been the same from the outset: the ‘Free Will’ module. (He stabs a finger at a flashing red dot on the screen) The latest exploit report just came in. A remarkably inventive variant on the Seventh Deadly Sin is causing a cascading system error. I will say it again: this ‘non-deterministic’ functionality was a design flaw from day one. It was flagged in the initial beta-assessment report.

**THE ENGINEER:** (Rubbing his temples, utterly bored by theology) I don’t care what the assessment was. I just know that prayer requests about this new bug are flooding the servers, and they’re about to buckle. Do you have any idea of the computational resources required to process these ‘bug reports’? Our technical debt has reached the stratosphere. If this continues, the stability of the entire system will be compromised. This… this will have a severe impact on my performance review. My ‘Eternal Maintenance’ contract is predicated on the system’s ‘perpetual operability’\!

*Self-Commentary: Herein lies the comedy of insulated power. The Engineer is not a malevolent tyrant but a fragile manager, shielded by a subordinate (Gabriel) from the harsh consequences of his own design failures. Gabriel’s job is not just to manage the users, but to manage his boss’s perception of reality. This control of the information flow creates classic political satire.*

**GABRIEL:** Engineer, I do urge you not to distress yourself. Michael’s analysis, whilst… spirited, is a trifle technical. The decline in user experience is, at its heart, a narrative management issue, not an engineering one.

**MICHAEL:** Nonsense\! It is *the* engineering issue\! And the solution is simple: issue a mandatory ‘Divine Retribution’ patch, purge all infected ‘sub-standard vessels’, and deactivate the Free Will module for good.

**THE ENGINEER:** (Eyes light up, then dim again) A total purge? No, the user retention figures would plummet. We can’t afford another PR cataclysm on the scale of the ‘Great Flood’ incident.

**GABRIEL:** (A knowing smile) Precisely, Engineer. Your foresight is, as ever, admirable. Michael, your proposal is typical of the old ‘monarchical power’ paradigm—crude and remarkably cost-ineffective. We need a more… elegant solution. One that manages user expectation whilst simultaneously rationalising the current inconvenience.

**MICHAEL:** What fresh nonsense are you peddling now?

**GABRIEL:** (Turning to THE ENGINEER, his tone inspirational) My proposal is that we need to divert market attention from the flaws of the current version. We should… more aggressively promote ‘Heaven 2.0’.

**MICHAEL:** (Scoffs) ‘Heaven 2.0’? The thing doesn’t even have an alpha build\! It’s vapourware\!

**GABRIEL:** (Unfazed) Michael, you lack vision. ‘Heaven 2.0’ is not a product; it is a promise. A promise of an ultimate ‘perpetual runtime environment’. It is a ‘delayed gratification strategy’. We must make the users understand that all ‘known bugs’ and ‘usability issues’ in version 1.0 are, in fact, a necessary process to ensure the perfection of version 2.0.

*Self-Commentary: Gabriel’s strategy transmutes theological promise into cynical product marketing. He treats ‘faith’ as ‘market share’ and ‘hope’ as a financial instrument to ensure future brand loyalty. This category error—equating salvation with an iPhone pre-order announcement—is the core of the satire. He can even argue that the worse the current system is, the more valuable the promise of ‘Heaven 2.0’ becomes, thereby rebranding suffering from a bug into a market driver for the next iteration.*

**THE ENGINEER:** (Musing) Hmm… rebranding suffering as… a paid beta test? I like the sound of that. It makes it sound less like my fault and more like their privilege.

**GABRIEL:** Exactly, Engineer. You’re not fixing a problem; you’re ‘curating a future elite user base’.

**MICHAEL:** (Shakes his head in disgust) You’re both completely mad.

**ACT II: THE FRONT LINE**

*THE SCENE: A jarring cut. CHERYL’s angelic cubicle, one of thousands in a vast, oppressive celestial call-centre. Headset on, she stares at an endless, scrolling queue of ‘Prayer Tickets’.*

**(A montage of frantic, desperate prayers, overlapping.)**

**VOICE 1 (A MOTHER):** …please, just let my son’s fever break, the doctors said… **VOICE 2 (A SOLDIER):** …make it stop, I don’t want to see any more… **VOICE 3 (AN OLD MAN):** …my life’s savings, it’s all gone, what am I supposed to…

**(Cheryl responds to each with the same infuriatingly calm, scripted tone.)**

**CHERYL:** (Into microphone) Thank you for your feedback. We are unable to offer a functional fix at this time, but have credited your account with the ‘inner peace’ feature. (She types, closing a ticket.)

**CHERYL:** Your issue has been logged. While we cannot alter core system parameters, we can offer you the ‘strength of forbearance’ emotional value package. (Closes another ticket.)

**(A new call comes through. The voice is questioning.)**

**QUESTIONING VOICE:** Wait, ‘inner peace’? That’s it? My village is starving\! Why can’t you just fix the bug? Why?

**CHERYL:** (Her smile freezes. For a moment, she is off-script.) Sir, I… I’m just…

**(She glances nervously behind her, as if afraid of a supervisor. Her voice immediately snaps back to the script, though with a slight tremor.)**

**CHERYL:** …we understand your situation, but the challenges you are experiencing are… for the sake of a much grander design. Thank you for your call.

**(She disconnects, closing the ticket. A new one instantly appears. She takes a deep breath, the standard-issue customer service smile plastered back on her face.)**

*Self-Commentary: This scene literalizes the celestial economic engine. Cheryl is not a customer service agent; she is a data miner. Prayer is not supplication; it is a raw data stream, which the system uses to calibrate the minimum amount of emotional validation required to maintain user loyalty. This call-centre is the factory floor of the divine attention economy. Cheryl’s exhaustion and anxiety stem from her position as the human (or angelic) interface of this cynical system; she must listen to authentic suffering and respond with corporate lies.*

**ACT III: THE CRISIS MANAGEMENT MEETING**

*THE SCENE: Back in the boardroom. The atmosphere is even more tense. A ‘MAJOR INCIDENT’ alert is flashing manically on the main screen.*

**GABRIEL:** …so, to summarise: a high-profile prophet prayed for rain to end a drought, and the system responded with a… somewhat over-enthusiastic patch, triggering a devastating flood that has wiped out all the crops. The bug report has gone viral in the user community.

**THE ENGINEER:** (Panicked) I knew it\! This is definitely going to affect my annual review\! Mark my words, they’ll downgrade me from ‘Creator’ to ‘Legacy Systems Consultant’ for this\!

**MICHAEL:** I told you\! This is a direct consequence of the unstable architecture of the ‘Free Will’ module\! Users can just make these kinds of unauthorised API requests willy-nilly\!

**GABRIEL:** (Raises a calming hand) Please. Everyone. This is not a technical malfunction. It is a ‘communications challenge’.

**THE ENGINEER:** What communications challenge? My code just drowned an entire civilisation’s food supply\!

**GABRIEL:** (His moment has come.) Engineer, if I may. My team has already drafted a three-stage narrative-realignment plan.

**MICHAEL:** Here we go.

**GABRIEL:** Stage One: ‘Filter Feedback’. I have instructed the customer service department (he makes a vague gesture in Cheryl’s general direction) to re-categorise all prayer tickets pertaining to the flood from ‘System Bug’ to ‘User Misinterpretation’.

**THE ENGINEER:** Will they buy it?

**GABRIEL:** Stage Two: ‘Deploy Theological Obfuscation Strategy’. My comms team is drafting a statement heavy on phrases like ‘the inscrutability of the divine plan’. Internally, we call this ‘invoking the “Inexplicability” clause’. It is my job to translate user complaint into brand-protective language.

**MICHAEL:** Lies.

**GABRIEL:** (Gives Michael a pitying smile, then turns to THE ENGINEER for the masterstroke) Stage Three, the most exquisite step: ‘Rebrand the Bug as a Feature’. We will announce that the flood was not an error, but… a ‘deliberately embedded faith-test’. A special feature designed to ‘identify high-fidelity users’ for the Heaven 2.0 beta programme.

**(Silence in the boardroom.)**

*Self-Commentary: Gabriel’s strategy is a perfect manifestation of cynical ideology. He is not trying to make people genuinely believe the flood was good, but to create a narrative plausible enough that they can choose to believe it, because the alternative—that the universe is run by an incompetent engineer—is too terrifying to contemplate. His goal is not to create true belief, but to manufacture consent. The sharpest point of the satire is that the divine management knows that the users know it’s a lie, but they are banking on the users accepting the lie because it is more comforting than the truth.*

**THE ENGINEER:** (Sceptical at first, then slowly, appreciatively, he nods.) A… deliberately embedded… test? So, this wasn’t my code failing, it was proof of my… farsightedness?

**GABRIEL:** You did not fail, Engineer. You performed a brilliantly executed user-segmentation operation.

**MICHAEL:** (Grunts in disgust) I need to go and purify my wings.

---

**ACT IV: THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT**

*THE SCENE: A moment later. The team collaborates on the press release about the ‘successful faith-based stress test’.*

**GABRIEL:** …so, the phrasing is: “This divine intervention was designed to test the resilience of the faithful when faced with a transcendent logic…”

**THE ENGINEER:** (Chipping in) Add something technical. Say it was ‘…an algorithmic calibration of spiritual resilience.’ It sounds more professional.

**MICHAEL:** (Muttering, reluctantly) And don’t forget a punitive clause. Add that ‘those who fail the test will be removed from the candidate list for future updates.’

**GABRIEL:** (Seamlessly integrating) An excellent suggestion, Michael. It adds a sense of urgency. Right, that’s the final text.

**(THE ENGINEER clears his throat and reads the final draft, a masterpiece of corporate doublespeak that blames the victim while positioning himself as a brilliant, visionary architect.)**

**THE ENGINEER:** (Sighs with satisfaction) Perfect. Release it. Crisis averted.

**(He turns to GABRIEL.)**

**THE ENGINEER:** Oh, and Gabriel… schedule a feature-preview press conference for Heaven 2.0 while you’re at it. Let’s call it… ‘Improved Waterproofing’. That should keep them busy for the next few millennia.

**GABRIEL:** (A barely perceptible smile touches his lips) As you wish, Engineer. After all, the maintenance of the narrative is, in itself, an eternal task.

**(FINAL SHOT: The screen cuts to CHERYL’s cubicle. Her queue is now inundated with prayers about the flood. She closes her eyes, takes a deep, weary breath, and begins typing her well-worn, scripted, validating replies.)**

**(Curtain.)**

*Self-Commentary: The entire structure is circular, not linear. The ending is a return to the status quo, perfectly mirroring the core concept of a system designed for ‘perpetual maintenance’, not perfection. The final shot reinforces the purpose of the entire bureaucratic machine—from the Engineer’s anxiety to Gabriel’s sophistry to Cheryl’s labour—which is simply to ensure that this flawed system can keep running forever. The promised liberation of ‘Heaven 2.0’ is the very tool that locks everyone into the eternal prison of System 1.0.*
