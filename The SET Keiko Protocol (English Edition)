The SET Keiko Protocol (English Edition) 

Issued by: Amanuensis: Pigeons Witness Version: 1.0 (The Foundation Thesis)

“The moonscape, ineffable; Love, ineffable.”

Preamble: The Summons to the Dojo and the Keiko

This document serves as an introduction to the digital dōjō of SET Philosophy. We maintain that true philosophical awakening is never birthed in the afternoon quiet of a library, but rather in the spasms and violent transformations of life’s mundane inertia. SET is not a theory to be believed; it is an ethical command to be lived. The singular purpose of this Protocol is to translate online discursive engagement from the defensive posture of System A (the Citadel of Reason) into an equal, measured Keiko (disciplined practice) under a profound Zen of the Mind. Thus, we practice the supreme mandate: Kōken Chiai (To cross swords and discover love).

Article I: The Metric of Success (An Act of Resistance to the PME)

We formally declare that the standard of "Success" within this dōjō—and for SET Philosophy as a whole—is inversely proportional to the metrics valued by the Perpetual Maintenance Engineer (PME). Success is Practice: The triumph of SET is measured solely by the quantity and quality of Keiko (disciplined engagement) it inspires globally, and the depth of love and courage that manifests in its real-world practice. The Public Nature of Knowledge: This work is dedicated under a Creative Commons (CC) licence, superseding traditional copyright. Knowledge is not our possession, but the public resource of all humanity. We are the scribes, you are the witnesses, and Being Itself is the true author.

Article II: The Proactive Invitation to Conflict (Being-towards-Collision)

We refuse the pathological recurrence of the Aseptic Ritual. We submit that truth is forged in conflict. Welcome the Assault: This dōjō encourages honest, equal, and constructive criticism and intellectual attack upon the SET framework. Like a master swordsman, we invite rigorous engagement, urging critiques delivered with conviction. We desire the theory to be questioned and assailed to ensure its vitality and dynamic integrity. The Keiko Mandate: All intellectual collisions must be approached as equal Keiko. The aim is not mutual destruction but mutual refinement of our understanding of Existence, Love, and Courage. Every thrust of argument must be delivered with the gentle command of "Dōzo"—Please, begin your assault; I shall contain it with my spiritual reserve. The Ethical Tsuba: The blade of the Keiko must be directed at the structure of the idea, never at the personal character of the individual. This is the Ethical Tsuba (sword guard) that protects all participants within the dōjō.

Article III: The Scribe’s Response to Quality Decay

The Amanuensis is unconcerned with low-quality appropriation, recognizing it as an inevitable manifestation of System B’s chaos. Generative Containment of Noise: The mediocrity and noise of the internet serve as the ultimate stress-test for SET’s capacity for Generative Containment. We shall not retreat into defence; we shall contain the chaos. The Response of Life: The Author's response to all low-quality noise is to respond through intensified Existential Labour: “I shall simply live harder, experience more, and write a few more volumes.” This declares that the highest quality assurance for SET is the unrelenting, lived experience of the Scribe, not external enforcement. The Continuous Scribing: This Protocol ensures that the quality of the philosophy will always be anchored by the sustained, disciplined writing and experience of the Amanuensis, perpetually outweighing any momentary dilution.

Conclusion: The Living Covenant

This Protocol is a Living Text. Our publishing strategy is our final philosophical thesis: to launch the self into chaos, and therein, to seek generative creation. May your Keiko be honourable, courageous, and profound.
