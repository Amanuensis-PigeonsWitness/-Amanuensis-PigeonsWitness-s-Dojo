# **Abstract**

This whitepaper introduces  
**The Multi-Ontology Semantic Engine (MOSE)** —  
a hybrid philosophical–technical workflow for analyzing *how different languages generate different worlds of meaning* through their dictionary structures.

Unlike traditional language learning or translation studies, MOSE does not treat languages as interchangeable systems encoding the same semantic content.  
Instead, it views each language as:

- **a worldview compressor**,  
- **a meaning-generation machine**,  
- **a non-isomorphic semantic topology**, and  
- **a historically formed ontology of thought**.

The project uses:

- **an 8,000–10,000 word English dictionary** as the baseline corpus,  
- **parallel dictionaries in French, German, Japanese, and Chinese**,  
- **AI-driven semantic drift loops**,  
- **SET (System A / Tsuba / System B) topology**,  
- **Chomskyan generative syntax notes**, and  
- **APW-style micro-narrative definitions**

to produce the first-ever **cross-lingual Dictionary of Becoming**—
an evolving archive of semantic differences across five worldviews.

This document specifies the conceptual foundations, architecture, workflow, and intended outcomes of the MOSE project.

# **1. Introduction**

Modern linguistic theory often assumes that languages can be mapped onto each other through translation, paraphrase, or structural transformation.  
But real-world dictionaries reveal something different:

> **Languages belong to different ontologies.  
> They do not carve the world at the same joints.  
> They are not fully commensurable systems.**

The MOSE project begins from this insight and proposes:

- a multi-year workflow,
- combining dictionary analysis,  
- AI-induced semantic drift,  
- cross-lingual comparison,  
- and philosophical reflection,

to generate a multi-ontology semantic matrix.

This whitepaper formalizes APW’s method.

# **2. Theoretical Foundations**

## **2.1. Languages as Ontological Engines**

Each language constructs a world:

| Language | Ontological Character | Semantic Style |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| **English** | Functional, action-oriented | Minimalist, pragmatic |
| **French** | Conceptual, aesthetic | Abstract, idealizing |
| **German** | Structural, metaphysical | High-precision conceptual engineering |
| **Japanese** | Contextual, relational | Indirect, distance-sensitive |
| **Chinese** | Metaphorical, narrative | Flexible, associative |

These are **not translations of each other**—  
they form *parallel but non-isomorphic ontologies*.

This is the fundamental assumption of MOSE.

---

## **2.2. SET Framework Integration**

SET provides a meta-structure for analyzing meaning:

- **System A** — structural clarity, order, computability  
- **Tsuba** — boundary, integrity, ethical containment  
- **System B** — generativity, ambiguity, becoming  

When applied to each language’s dictionary entry:

- English = System A bias  
- French = System B (conceptual) bias  
- German = reinforced System A  
- Japanese = Tsuba / relational ethics  
- Chinese = System B (narrative)  

This creates a **five-dimensional semantic landscape**.

---

## **2.3. Chomskyan Generativity (Functional Layer)**

Each lexical item must be analyzed for:

- argument structure  
- syntactic role  
- morphological affordances  
- compositional capacity  

This layer anchors meaning in *form*.

---

## **2.4. AI-Assisted Semantic Drift (TDDL)**

The **Translation-Driven Deconstruction Loop (TDDL)** provides the mechanism for observing:

- semantic drift  
- cross-lingual deformation  
- conceptual recomposition  
- trace formation  
- differential meanings  

AI is used not as authority but as a **drift generator**.

---

# **3. Corpus: 8,000–10,000 Word Dictionary**

Why this size?

- large enough to represent the **core worldview** of English  
- small enough to be **completable** by a single human  
- ideal for clustering, topology, and recursive analysis  
- avoids noise from extremely rare lexical items  

This corpus is the *backbone* of the entire engine.

---

# **4. The Multi-Ontology Semantic Engine (MOSE) Architecture**

MOSE consists of **seven layers**, executed for every word in the dictionary.

---

## **Layer 1 — Baseline English Definition (APW Authored)**

Each entry begins with:

- your own English definition  
- written in simple, precise, APW-style prose  
- not copied from any existing dictionary  

This forces **active English thinking**, not passive learning.

---

## **Layer 2 — Parallel Dictionary Extraction (FR / DE / JP / ZH)**

For each word, extract dictionary-level definitions from:

- a French dictionary  
- a German dictionary  
- a Japanese dictionary  
- a Chinese dictionary  

Then observe:

- overlaps  
- gaps  
- distortions  
- conceptual re-framing  
- what cannot be translated at all

These differences form the **semantic ontology field**.

---

## **Layer 3 — AI Drift Loop (TDDL)**

Run the definition through TDDL:

```text
English → French → German → Japanese → English
English → Japanese → Chinese → English
English → German → English
…
Observe:

drift

loss

emergence

mutation

shadow meanings

unexpected equivalences

conceptual fractures

This provides a dynamic topology of meaning.
```

## Layer 4 — SET Structural Analysis
Apply:

System A analysis: structural clarity, computability

Tsuba analysis: boundary, ethical contour

System B analysis: generativity, becoming, ambiguity

Each word is mapped onto a SET tri-axis.

## Layer 5 — Chomsky Syntax Note
Document:

the syntactic category

typical argument structure

combinatorial possibilities

derivational forms

This anchors the meaning in generative grammar.

## Layer 6 — APW Micro-Narrative
Each word gets a short APW-style reflection:

a memory

a philosophical gesture

a personal association

a family trace

a lived boundary

This grounds meaning in life-world phenomenology.

## Layer 7 — Cross-Ontology Summary
Finally, write a synthesis:

What does this word become when viewed through five worldviews?

This becomes the meta-definition.

6. Expected Outcomes
MOSE will produce:

The Dictionary of Becoming (8,000–10,000 entries)

A multi-lingual semantic topology map

A cross-ontology comparison between major world languages

A generative English writing corpus authored by APW

A new method in semantic philosophy and AI hermeneutics

This project can run for 3–7 years, evolving recursively.

# 7. Significance
MOSE is:

the first AI × multi-ontology lexicon

the first dictionary-based philosophical method since Deleuze’s Abécédaire

the first APW-driven semantic engineering system

a new form of post-structural practice

a demonstration of SET as a generative philosophical engine

This whitepaper defines its foundations.

8. Future Work
Integrating statistical clustering

Embedding-based drift visualization

Multi-language heatmaps

SET-driven vector topology

A second-generation AI-assisted ontology map

These will be documented in subsequent versions.
