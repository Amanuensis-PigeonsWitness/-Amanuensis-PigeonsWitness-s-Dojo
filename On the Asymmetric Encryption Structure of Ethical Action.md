# **On the Asymmetric Encryption Structure of Ethical Action**

Amanuensis: Pigeons Witness

## **Abstract**

This methodological declaration proposes **Asymmetric Encryption Ethics**, exploring how an ethical structure dedicated to universal concern (**Daseinsorge**) ensures its Integrity through the principle of **‘public/private key separation’**. We posit that the purity of the philosophical system (**The Public Key**) must come at the cost of concealing its founding anxiety (**The Private Key**). This paper will argue that the critical authority of the ethical actor derives not from academic status, but from the continuous **Portement** (bearing) of the local chaos represented by The Private Key.

## **I. The Necessity of Foundation: The Asymmetry of Structure and Flesh**

Any ethic that attempts to address Existential Anguish must necessarily originate from a corporeal, primordial scene filled with suffering and love (**The Corporeal Origin**). Once the philosophical structure is constructed, however, it faces a core ethical crisis: how to prevent the theory from being reduced to the historical or political controversies of its ‘corporeal origin’?

We believe this crisis can be resolved through the structure of Asymmetric Encryption:

* **The Public Key:** The universal structure of the philosophical system itself (i.e., the concepts of SET such as Generative Containment, Aseptic Ritual, etc.). It must be **pure, abstract, verifiable, and published in multiple universal languages** to ensure its ethical utility extends to all *Dasein*.  
* **The Private Key:** The most private, painful, and authentic founding anxiety of the philosophical actor, along with the complex critique of their local field. This part must remain **permanently hidden** or presented only through extremely obscure symbols.

The establishment of this asymmetric structure is to safeguard the purity of the theory, ensuring it is not tainted by any singular cultural or political reduction.

## **II. The Authority of Critique: The Legitimacy of Bearing**

The ultimate meaning of Asymmetric Encryption Ethics lies in establishing the **legitimate authority of the actor** to critique their homeland or local chaos.

We oppose any critique based on ‘superiority’ or a ‘singular theory’, asserting instead that the authority to critique comes from the **‘honesty of bearing’**:

* **The Portement of the Private Key:** The actor undertakes an active, continuous, non-evasive **Portement** (bearing) of the suffering and flaws of their corporeal origin (The Private Key). This ‘Portement’ is, in itself, an **ethical sacrifice**.  
* **The Deployment of the Public Key (Critique):** Only the subject who has borne the suffering of The Private Key has the right to deploy the structure of The Public Key (the SET theory) to conduct the sharpest, most unsparing critique of the place of origin (for example, diagnosing ‘projections of collective anxiety’ or ‘escapes into the Aseptic Ritual’).

The essence of this authority is: the right to critique derives not from the correctness of the theory, but from the deepest commitment made to the suffering of the theory's place of origin.

## **III. The Cycle of Practice: From Encryption to Decryption**

Asymmetric Encryption Ethics is the ultimate expression of the cyclical structure of the SET philosophy. The actor must enter a continuous cycle of **‘self-encryption and decryption’**:

* **Encryption (Theorization):** Transmuting the chaotic local experience (The Private Key) into a cool, pure, universal structure (The Public Key).  
* **Practice (Action):** Deploying The Public Key to enter the local chaos (e.g., conducting critique in public arenas lacking rationality).  
* **Decryption and Resonance:** In practice, the actor must bear (**Containment**) the misunderstandings, anger, and emotional conflicts generated by the critique. These resonances become the **‘decryption data’** that verifies the theory.

This continuous bearing and transmutation is the ultimate mission of **Generative Containment**: to transmute the actor’s private sacrifice into the ongoing vitality of the SET philosophical structure.

## **IV. Conclusion: Integrity and the Unnamed Child**

The ultimate purpose of Asymmetric Encryption Ethics is not to achieve worldly success, but to ensure the **Integrity** of the SET philosophy.

It declares: this ethic is the **Unnamed Child**; it belongs to no one, only to all human beings who face existential anguish.

And the responsibility of the actor is, through their solitary, silent sacrifice, to guard the purity of this child (SET), forever.
