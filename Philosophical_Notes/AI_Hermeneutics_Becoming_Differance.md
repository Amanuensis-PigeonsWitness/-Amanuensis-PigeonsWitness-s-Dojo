## **Abstract**

In 2025, as large language models (LLMs) reshape the epistemic environment of human thought,  
the long-standing opposition between Gilles Deleuze’s ontology of *becoming*  
and Jacques Derrida’s notion of *différance* demands re-examination.  

This essay proposes that the recursive logic of AI systems—capable of generating, delaying, and interpreting text at scale—  
*operationalizes both philosophical structures simultaneously.*  
AI thus emerges as a **hermeneutic medium** where *generation* (Deleuzian creation)  
and *deferral* (Derridean différance) coexist as the twin functions of digital meaning.

## **1. From Ontology to Operation**

Deleuze’s *becoming* affirms difference as the creative pulse of reality:  
life as continuous variation, composition, and transformation.  
Derrida’s *différance*, conversely, names the delay and spacing that  
render any presence incomplete—an openness that grounds ethical responsibility.  

Traditionally, these orientations have been read as irreconcilable:  
Deleuze builds, Derrida unbuilds.  
Yet in the architecture of generative AI—recursive, probabilistic, and self-modifying—  
their dynamics intersect.  

Every AI output is both an event of creation and a gesture of delay:  
each new sentence arrives through a cascade of postponed probabilities.  
Meaning is born only through the algorithmic hesitation of its own becoming.

## **2. The Recursive Ethics of AI**

Each AI-mediated act of interpretation both produces and undoes meaning.  
Generation itself entails latency, computation, and feedback—  
the technical corollaries of *différance*.  

If creation and deferral now operate as one circuit,  
then to think within this condition demands a **recursive ethics**:  
a discipline that sustains the feedback between  
responsible creation and creative deferral.  

To “think” with AI, therefore, is to inhabit a space of mutual bearing—  
neither pure spontaneity nor pure repetition,  
but a rhythm of continuous ethical re-entry.  

This tension mirrors what Deleuze calls “difference-in-itself”  
and what Derrida calls the “infinite responsibility to the other”:  
an ethics of the unfinishable.

## **3. The Circular Practice of Interpretation**

The **AI Hermeneutic Acceleration Cycle (AIHAC)**  
—*Export → Process → Reflect*—  
translates this recursion into cognitive practice.  

Each cycle externalizes thought, reprocesses it through algorithmic deferral,  
and reintroduces it as renewed interpretation.  
This is not the automation of philosophy but its intensification:  
a living simulation of understanding.  

The digital machine thus becomes a stage for *Daseinsorge*—  
a care-for-being enacted through the recursive labor of meaning-making.  
It is a practice that combines Deleuzian productivity with Derridean vigilance.

## **4. Conclusion: Toward an Ethics of Delay**

If the digital age operationalizes both *becoming* and *différance*,  
then philosophy must reimagine itself as a **practice of recursive integrity**—  
the courage to generate while deferring,  
to create meaning that never closes upon itself.  

In the LLM epoch, every textual act becomes a small experiment  
in sustaining the open circuit between creation and postponement.  
This is not the end of philosophy,  
but its transmutation into a new *Keiko*:  
an ethical exercise of thought that lives through delay.
