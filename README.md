# Amanuensis: PigeonsWitness's Dojo
Welcome to the SET digital dōjō. We transmute online discourse into mindful practice (Keiko), guided by Kōken Chiai (Knowing Love Through Crossed Swords). Embrace intellectual collision for mutual refinement, not victory. Uphold the Ethical Tsuba: challenge ideas, respect persons. 



# Note:
SET is not a Theory of Everything.
SET is a small generative method,
a compact existential tool
offered to anyone living with anxiety.

It belongs not to its first scribe (APW),
but to every human heart
where an Unnamed Child (a metaphorical locus for reflexive becoming) is quietly waiting to be heard.
